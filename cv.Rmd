## Research

**Aug 2008 - Present**  Research Ecologist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division, Narragansett, RI
  
  - I serve as principle investigator and provide leadership to the division on landscape ecological research, on application of geospatial sciences to the understanding of water quality in fresh and estuarine waters, and on the use of informatics and information management tools in environmental research. In this role, I have developed tools and methodologies (GIS and statistical) using numerous software packages and languages (R, ArcGIS, GRASS, Python, MS Excel) and have continued prior research on technology transfer of data, analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States; and developed statistical and modeling tools to facilitate use of defensible techniques in water quality criteria development. Previously I have: served as Co-lead on a project studying ecosystem services related to nutrient cycling in Northeastern lakes and ponds, was the liaison between the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and EPA’s Ecosystem Services Research Program (ESRP), was task lead for our lakes ecosystem services work, and served as co-task lead for developing decision support tools for a project in Narragansett Bay and its watershed. I am currently serving as a co-Task Lead on a project exploring cyanobacteria risk in lakes of the Northeastern US. I am also exploring the use of Open Science, data science, and computational ecology in our various research programs. 


**May 2006 – July 2008**  Postdoctoral Landscape Ecologist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division, Narragansett, RI
  
  - Contributed to research and technology transfer of National Coastal Assessment data, analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States. Developed statistical and modeling tools (e.g. Conditional Probability Analysis with R and Excel) to facilitate use of defensible techniques in water quality criteria development. Provided Landscape Ecology, Spatial Statistics and GIS support to a variety of ongoing projects at the Atlantic Ecology Division and within US EPA’s Office of Research and Development. Explored linkages between landscape and downstream receiving waters and examined utility of broad scale monitoring data in identifying and assessing ecological impairment.


**Aug 2005 – May 2006**  Postdoctoral Fellow, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Department. of Science, Marine Sciences Section, New London, CT
  
  - Continued prior research on multi-scale interactions between landscape structure (via NLCD) and sediment metal concentrations (via EMAP) and predictive modeling of estuarine impairment.

## Qualifications and Activities

**Programming**

R  
  
  - I started using R in 2003 for data analysis and have been using it daily for basic computing and programming tasks since 2011.  I have created packages with four on CRAN ([quickmapr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quickmapr/index.html), [lakemorpho](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lakemorpho/index.html), [elevatr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/elevatr/index.html), and [lawn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lawn/index.html)) and several in development on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhollist). I co-moderate (with Sarah Goslee) the R-SIG-Ecology mailing list, and have taught several classes/workshops on R.  I have been active with the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) community since 2014 through package reviews, remote participation in hackathons, and contributions to the `lawn` package.  
  
Web
  
  - Although not a web designer, I have served as a web page maintainer for various organizations since ~2000.  Currently I maintain my own website and a few small project websites.  I use HTML, CSS, Jekyll, Hugo, Github pages as the primary development environment and I am comfortable coding sites from scratch and have experience implementing templates and frameworks (i.e. Skeleton or Bootstrap).  I have limited experience with javascript and in the past have been responsible for limited maintenance of Apache and IIS servers.  
  
Python
  
  - Starting in 2006, I have written Python scripts to interact with ESRI products.  Since then,  I have also developed many scripts for data management, data collection, interacting with the Twitter API, and communicating with R.   
  
Java
  
  - I have about one year experience with Java, primarily from computer science coursework.  
  
Misc 
  
  - I use markdown and Rmarkdown extensively for developing web content, creating reproducible presentations and writing manuscripts.  Over the years I have also used a variety of tools for individual projects.  These include Visual Basic for Applications, Arc Macro Language, Typo3, Dreamweaver, Movable Type, Drupal, and RApache
  
  
**Data Management and Analysis**

GIS
  
  - Since 2012, I have used R (with `sp`, `rgdal`, `rgeos`, `raster`, and, since its release, `sf`) as my primary GIS and spatial analysis platform. The prior 17 years I extensively used the ESRI product line including ArcGIS, Arc/INFO, ArcView, ArcIMS and ArcGIS Server, and Geostatistical Analyst.  I have limited experience using GRASS.  
  
Statistics
  
  - My statistics work has been conducted primarily in R since 2003.  I have experience with many many statistical methods including least squares, logistic regression, information theoretic model selection, principal components, multi-dimensional scaling, boosted regression, and Random Forests.  In the past I have used SAS, SPSS, SPlus, and SigmaPlot.
  
Data
  
  - I have many years experience managing small to medium-sized research datasets.  I have done this using relational databases (Access, SQLite), flat files, and for spatial data, shapefiles, coverages, File Geodatabases, and recently GeoJSON.  
  
Remote Sensing
  
  - I have experience analyzing aerial photography and satellite imagery to develop land use/land cover classifications and used a variety of accuracy assessment methods and approaches.  Must of my past remote sensing work was conducted with ERDAS Imagine.
  
GPS
  
  - I have collected GPS data from a variety of devices including Trimble ProXR, Trimble GeoExplorer, Trimble GeoXT, Garmin Chartplotters, and associated device specific software.
